# 🧠 Memory & Context Management Guide

## Why Memory/Context Matters

With a 27B parameter model and your 64GB RAM + RTX 4080, you can maintain **extensive conversation history** and **persistent knowledge** across sessions. Here's how to maximize it.

## 🎯 Context Window Explained

Your setup supports up to **16,384 tokens** (~65,000 characters) of context:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  16,384 Total Token Budget          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  System Prompt:      ~100 tokens    │
│  Context Files:      ~3,000 tokens  │
│  Chat History:       ~11,000 tokens │
│  Response Buffer:    ~2,284 tokens  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What this means:**
- The model can "remember" ~100-120 messages back
- Plus all your context files
- Plus generate very long, detailed responses

**This is HUGE compared to most setups!** Most consumer systems max out at 4K-8K tokens.

## 📁 Context Files: Your Persistent Memory

Context files are the **secret weapon** for maintaining knowledge across conversations.

### When to Create Context Files

1. **Project Information**
   ```
   File: project_xyz.txt
   
   Project: XYZ Web App
   Tech Stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
   Key Features: User auth, real-time chat, file upload
   Database Schema: [paste schema]
   API Endpoints: [list endpoints]
   Current Sprint: Focus on payment integration
   ```

2. **Personal Preferences**
   ```
   File: my_preferences.txt
   
   Code Style:
   - Use TypeScript over JavaScript
   - Prefer functional components
   - Always add error handling
   - Comments for complex logic only
   
   Communication:
   - Be concise but thorough
   - Show examples with explanations
   - Technical depth over hand-holding
   ```

3. **Domain Knowledge**
   ```
   File: medical_terminology.txt
   
   [For medical coding project]
   ICD-10 Codes: [list]
   Common Abbreviations: [list]
   Billing Rules: [details]
   ```

4. **Ongoing Research**
   ```
   File: research_notes.txt
   
   Topic: Machine Learning Optimization
   Key Papers: [list with summaries]
   Experiments: [results]
   Next Steps: [action items]
   ```

### Best Practices for Context Files

**✅ DO:**
- Keep files focused on specific topics
- Update regularly as info changes
- Use clear, structured format
- Include dates for time-sensitive info
- Name files descriptively

**❌ DON'T:**
- Create one massive file with everything
- Include redundant information
- Let files get stale/outdated
- Use vague names like "notes.txt"

### Recommended File Structure

```
context_files/
├── personal/
│   ├── preferences.txt
│   ├── common_commands.txt
│   └── workflow.txt
├── projects/
│   ├── project_alpha_spec.txt
│   ├── project_alpha_apis.txt
│   └── project_beta_overview.txt
├── learning/
│   ├── python_snippets.txt
│   ├── rust_notes.txt
│   └── algorithms.txt
└── reference/
    ├── regex_patterns.txt
    ├── git_workflows.txt
    └── sql_queries.txt
```

## 🔄 Auto-Memory Extraction

The system automatically extracts important information when you use keywords:

### Trigger Phrases

- **"My name is..."** → Stores name
- **"I like/prefer..."** → Stores preference
- **"Remember that..."** → High priority storage
- **"Important:"** → Flags as critical info
- **"Always/Never..."** → Stores as rule

### Example

**You:** "Remember that I always want code examples in TypeScript, not JavaScript. Also, my project uses React 18 with Vite."

**System:** 
- ✅ Stored: TypeScript preference
- ✅ Stored: React 18 + Vite stack
- 🔖 Tagged as "always" rule
- 💾 Available in future sessions

## 🎛️ Context Window Settings

### Adjusting for Your Needs

**For Coding/Technical Work:**
```yaml
context_window: 16384  # Use MAXIMUM!
max_tokens: 2048       # Long code responses
temperature: 0.3-0.5   # More focused
```

**For Deep Research:**
```yaml
context_window: 16384  # Use MAXIMUM!
max_tokens: 3072       # Very detailed analysis
temperature: 0.7       # Balanced
```

**For Quick Q&A:**
```yaml
context_window: 8192   # Still large, faster
max_tokens: 1024       # Brief answers
temperature: 0.7       # Balanced
```

**For All-Day Coding Session:**
```yaml
context_window: 16384  # Keep ENTIRE conversation in memory
max_tokens: 2048       # Detailed code
temperature: 0.4       # Consistent style
# With 16K tokens, you can code for HOURS without losing context!
```

## 🚀 Advanced Memory Techniques

### 1. **Session Summaries**

After a long coding session, ask:
```
"Summarize what we've built today in a format 
I can save as a context file."
```

The model will generate a structured summary you can save and load in future sessions.

### 2. **Checkpoint System**

Every 20-30 messages, create a checkpoint:
```
"Create a context file called 'checkpoint_[date].txt' 
with: what we discussed, decisions made, and next steps."
```

### 3. **Cross-Session Knowledge**

When starting a new session:
1. Load relevant context files
2. Briefly mention: "We were working on [topic]"
3. The model picks up where you left off

### 4. **Memory Refresh**

If context seems lost:
```
"Reload context from: project_spec.txt, my_preferences.txt"
```

## 📊 Monitoring Context Usage

The UI shows:
- **Current context size** (in tokens)
- **Messages in memory** (how many chat messages)
- **Context files loaded** (which files active)
- **Tokens remaining** (for response)

### When You're Near Limit

**Option 1: Create Summary**
```
"Summarize our conversation so far, save as context file, 
then start a new session."
```

**Option 2: Selective History**
```
"Keep only messages about [specific topic], 
clear the rest."
```

**Option 3: Increase Window**
- Adjust context_window slider (may slow generation)

## 🎓 Pro Tips

### 1. **Pre-Load Morning Context**

Create a "daily_start.txt":
```
Date: 2025-09-29
Active Projects: Project X, Learning Rust
Today's Focus: Implement user authentication
Blockers: Need to decide on JWT vs Session
```

Load this every morning to get the model oriented.

### 2. **Error Pattern Learning**

Keep "common_errors.txt":
```
Error: "Module not found"
Usually means: Import path issue
Fix: Check relative vs absolute paths

Error: "Type 'undefined' is not assignable"
Usually means: Missing null check
Fix: Add optional chaining (?.)
```

### 3. **Personal Knowledge Base**

Build a mini-wiki of your expertise:
- `networking_basics.txt`
- `docker_commands.txt`
- `bash_scripts.txt`

The model accesses these instantly, like your personal Stack Overflow.

### 4. **Project Templates**

Save successful project structures:
```
File: react_project_template.txt

Standard Setup:
/src
  /components
  /hooks
  /utils
  /types
  
Key Files:
- vite.config.ts: [your config]
- tsconfig.json: [your config]
- package.json: [common deps]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Model seems to forget things"

**Check:**
1. Context window setting (should be 6144-8192)
2. How many messages back you're referencing
3. If relevant context files are loaded

**Solution:**
- Increase context_window slider
- Load more context files
- Create summary of key info

### "Responses are slow"

**Cause:** Large context window + high token generation

**Solution:**
- Reduce context_window to 4096
- Reduce max_tokens to 512-1024
- Remove unnecessary context files

### "Context files not working"

**Check:**
1. Files are in `context_files/` directory
2. Files are selected in UI checkboxes
3. Files are UTF-8 encoded
4. File size reasonable (<50KB each)

## 📈 Optimal Configuration for 64GB RAM + RTX 4080

```yaml
# Your MAXIMUM performance settings
context_window: 16384     # Use your RAM advantage!
max_tokens: 2048          # Long, detailed responses
temperature: 0.7          # Balanced creativity
context_files: 10-15      # Load many knowledge files
session_autosave: true    # Never lose work
memory_extraction: true   # Auto-learn preferences
```

## 🎯 Example Workflow

**Monday Morning:**
```
1. Load: daily_goals.txt, active_projects.txt
2. Context window: 16384 (keep EVERYTHING)
3. "What's on the agenda based on context files?"
4. Code all day - model remembers the ENTIRE session
```

**During Work:**
```
5. Model references your preferences automatically
6. Auto-extracts new learnings
7. Maintains 100+ messages of history
8. Never asks "what were we working on?"
```

**End of Day:**
```
9. "Summarize today's progress"
10. Save summary as context file
11. Update active_projects.txt
12. Tomorrow: Pick up EXACTLY where you left off
```

**Next Session:**
```
13. Load updated context files
14. Model has FULL context of previous session
15. Continue like you never stopped
16. Zero ramp-up time
```

## 🌟 The Power of Persistent Memory

With proper context management, you're building a **personalized AI assistant** that:

- 📚 Knows your coding style
- 🎯 Understands your projects
- 🧠 Remembers your preferences
- 📊 Tracks your progress
- 🚀 Gets smarter with each session

Your 64GB RAM and RTX 4080 make this possible at a level most users can't achieve. Use it!
