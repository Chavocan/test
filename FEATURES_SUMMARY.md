## 🎨 Feature Deep Dive

### 1. Context Management (★ Star Feature)

**16,384 Token Window:**
```
Normal Systems:  4K-8K tokens
Your System:     16K tokens (2-4x more!)

= 100-120 messages
= 65,000 characters  
= 10,000-13,000 words
= Full day's conversation
```

**Three-Stage Monitoring:**
- 🟢 0-79%: Normal operation
- 🟡 80-89%: Warning + suggestions
- 🔴 90%+: Auto-creates summary file

**Auto-Compression:**
```
Before: 100 messages (12K tokens)
After:  Summary file (500 tokens)
        + Last 20 messages active
        
Compression: 24:1 ratio
Time saved: Hours of re-explaining
```

### 2. Personality System (Zero Scripts!)

**8 Personality Dimensions:**
```
1. Formality     (casual ↔ professional)
2. Enthusiasm    (calm ↔ energetic)
3. Directness    (diplomatic ↔ blunt)
4. Verbosity     (brief ↔ detailed)
5. Supportiveness (neutral ↔ encouraging)
6. Playfulness   (serious ↔ witty)
7. Technicality  (simple ↔ expert)
8. Assertiveness (tentative ↔ confident)
```

**7 Pre-built Presets:**
- Default Assistant
- Coding Buddy ⭐ (your style: direct, technical)
- Patient Teacher
- Research Assistant
- Creative Partner
- Professional Consultant
- Casual Friend

**Example: Coding Buddy**
```yaml
Directness: 90      # Get to the point
Technicality: 95    # Deep technical detail
Supportiveness: 30  # Matter-of-fact
Verbosity: 50       # Concise but complete
```

**Result:** Natural responses that FEEL right, never canned phrases!

### 3. Voice Processing (NO Piper!)

**Text-to-Speech (Edge TTS):**
```
Engine: Microsoft Edge TTS
Quality: Neural voices (natural!)
Voices: 50+ options
Default: en-US-GuyNeural (male, natural)

Compare to Piper: 
  Piper:     ⚠️ Robotic, unpleasant
  Edge TTS:  ✅ Natural, human-like
```

**Speech-to-Text (Faster-Whisper):**
```
Engine: Faster-Whisper
Model: Medium (accurate + fast)
Device: CUDA (your RTX 4080)
Speed: Real-time or faster
Accuracy: ~95% in good conditions
```

**Voice Workflow:**
```
1. Click mic → Record
2. Auto-transcribe (1-2 seconds)
3. Generate response
4. Auto-play audio (instant)

Total: ~20-25 seconds for full cycle
```

### 4. Context Files System

**Persistent Knowledge:**
```
context_files/
├── personal/
│   ├── preferences.txt        # Your style
│   └── common_commands.txt    # Frequent tasks
├── projects/
│   ├── project_alpha.txt      # Project A details
│   └── project_beta.txt       # Project B details
├── learning/
│   ├── rust_notes.txt         # Study materials
│   └── algorithms.txt         # Reference
├── reference/
│   ├── regex_patterns.txt     # Quick lookup
│   └── sql_queries.txt        # Common queries
└── auto_generated/
    └── auto_context_*.txt     # Auto-summaries
```

**Features:**
- Unlimited files
- Category organization
- Search across files
- Token-aware loading
- Auto-generated summaries
- Cross-session sharing

**Power Move:**
```
Load: project_spec.txt, my_prefs.txt, api_docs.txt

Model now knows:
- Your entire project
- Your coding style
- All your APIs

Result: Expert responses instantly!
```

### 5. Memory Extraction

**Auto-Learn Keywords:**
```
"My name is..."        → Stores name
"I prefer..."          → Stores preference  
"Remember that..."     → High priority
"Important:"           → Flags as critical
"Always/Never..."      → Stores as rule
"I like/hate..."       → Stores preference
```

**Example:**
```
You: "Remember that I always want TypeScript 
      examples, not JavaScript. I work with 
      React 18 and prefer functional components."

System stores:
✓ Language preference: TypeScript
✓ Framework: React 18
✓ Style: Functional components
✓ Auto-applies to future responses!
```

### 6. Internet Access

**Web Search (DuckDuckGo):**
```
- Privacy-focused
- No tracking
- 5 results per search
- Title + URL + snippet
```

**URL Fetching:**
```
- Extract clean text
- Remove ads/navigation
- Limit to 10K characters
- Parse metadata
```

**Use Cases:**
```
1. Research: "Search latest Python features"
2. Verification: "Check current exchange rate"
3. Learning: "Find tutorials on Rust lifetimes"
4. Updates: "What's new in React 19?"
```

### 7. Screen Control & Automation

**Capture:**
- Full screen screenshots
- Region capture
- Auto-save to temp

**Automation:**
```python
actions = [
    {"type": "move", "x": 500, "y": 300},
    {"type": "click"},
    {"type": "type", "text": "Hello"},
    {"type": "key", "key": "enter"},
    {"type": "scroll", "clicks": -3}
]
```

**Safety:**
- Confirmation prompts
- Failsafe (move to corner to abort)
- Coordinate validation
- Action logging

### 8. File Management

**Supported Formats:**
- Documents: .txt, .pdf, .docx, .md
- Data: .csv, .xlsx, .json
- Code: .py, .js, .html, .css, etc.

**Features:**

```

**Session Data:**
```json
{
  "id": "20250929_090000",
  "messages": [...],
  "personality": {...},
  "context_files": [...],
  "memory_items": [...],
  "important_facts": {...},
